This Python program captures keystrokes and saves them to a file. It is important to note that keyloggers come with ethical considerations, and they must be used responsibly and with proper authorization.

Features:
1. Keystroke Recording: Captures all keystrokes entered on the keyboard.
2. File Logging: Saves the recorded keystrokes to a text file for future analysis.
